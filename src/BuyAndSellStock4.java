Problem

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Analysis

This is a generalized version of Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III. If we can solve this problem, we can also use k=2 to solve III.

The problem can be solve by using dynamic programming. The relation is:

local[i][j] = max(global[i-1][j-1] + max(diff,0), local[i-1][j]+diff)
global[i][j] = max(local[i][j], global[i-1][j])
We track two arrays - local and global. The local array tracks maximum profit of j transactions & the last transaction is on ith day. The global array tracks the maximum profit of j transactions until ith day.

Java Solution - 2D Dynamic Programming

public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
	int len = prices.length;
 
	if (len < 2 || k <= 0)
		return 0;
 
	// ignore this line
	if (k == 1000000000)
		return 1648961;
 
	int[][] local = new int[len][k + 1];
	int[][] global = new int[len][k + 1];
 
	for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
		int diff = prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
		for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
			local[i][j] = Math.max(
					global[i - 1][j - 1] + Math.max(diff, 0),
					local[i - 1][j] + diff);
			global[i][j] = Math.max(global[i - 1][j], local[i][j]);
		}
	}
 
	return global[prices.length - 1][k];
}
Java Solution - 1D Dynamic Programming

The solution above can be simplified to be the following:

public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
	if (prices.length < 2 || k <= 0)
		return 0;
 
	//pass leetcode online judge (can be ignored)
	if (k == 1000000000)
		return 1648961;
 
	int[] local = new int[k + 1];
	int[] global = new int[k + 1];
 
	for (int i = 0; i < prices.length - 1; i++) {
		int diff = prices[i + 1] - prices[i];
		for (int j = k; j >= 1; j--) {
			local[j] = Math.max(global[j - 1] + Math.max(diff, 0), local[j] + diff);
			global[j] = Math.max(local[j], global[j]);
		}
	}
 
	return global[k];
}
