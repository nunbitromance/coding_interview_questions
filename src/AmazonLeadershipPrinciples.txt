STAR stands for:

* Situation - What was the situation you / your previous employer faced?
* Task - What tasks were involved in that situation?
* Action - What actions did you take?
* Results - What were the results of those actions?

Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
- Example 1: Customers were reporting issues on Facebook that they were seeing wrong price charged on credit card for installment. I investigated and suggested that we add descriptors to payment transactions.
- Example 2:
- Example 3:

Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job." 
- Example 1: Site dev manager was let go. Site engineers were having difficulty with performance issues. I helped.
- Example 2: CS application team was struggling with issues. I helped them.
- Example 3: 

Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". Because we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
- Example 1: A/B Testing framework vs purchasing third party software which added complexity

Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgement and good instincts.  They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
- Example 1: 

Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
- Example 1: 

Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognise people with exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organisation. Leaders develop leaders and are serious about their role in coaching others.  We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
- Hire: 4 new engineers
- Fire: 1 existing engineer

Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
- SLA on P0: 100% response within 5 minutes
- Testing, Metrics, Alerts, and Monitoring on all new features

Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
- AWS Migration of store infrastructure

Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 
- Mongo upgrade. rollback plan. volatility but took risk and proceeded.

Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.  There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.
- Decommission of New Relic. Switch to Data Dog. Saved 90% of cost.

Earn Trust
 Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.  Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odour smells of perfume.  They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are sceptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never compromise.

Behavioral Questions - Related to 12 Leadership Principles!!!
==================================================================
- give me an example of most difficult/complex project: Groupon - Inventory Management Service -> drifting -> (Dive Deep) -> warehouse management. Shipment tracking service - a lot of maintenance.

- give me an example of most exciting project: Smart Pay - 20% revenue

- give me a time when you hired wrong person: Took someone in who was passionate about maintaining existing service that came with him. Not willing to learn new languages. Had long discussions on areas to improved. He did not show motivation to improve. Had to put him on performance improvement plan. Had to document his tasks actual vs expected every day. Eventually, had to let him go after discussion with HR.

- give me a time when you hired someone who was successful: Hired someone from another company who was struggling because he wanted to do something exciting and challenging and his manager would not let him. Joined my team and I gave him in charge of something interesting. He took himself to next level and completed project very successfully.

- how do you handle low performers? document. plan. evaluate and discuss: Have a one to one meeting with him. Check with him if he is facing any roadblocks in completing his tasks. Document plan and evaluations. If required arrange a training course for him or assign a mentor to work with him. Once training is over, give him ownership of some tasks and see if there is any improvement. If he expresses interest in some other area of work, help him in getting in touch with managers in that area and ensure a smooth transition for him and for the team.

- how do you handle decision conflicts in the team? open discussion with all the members and try to draw natural concensus through discussion on alternatives about pros and cons. come to agreement.

- how do you build a team? focus on common goals. set expectations for both short term and long term. celebrate success and failures.

- Tell me a project where you had to deliver a product in 6 months and how did you approach planning for it?
In any project, the first thing is do understand the requirements in detail and try to come up with a high level estimation based on team's velocity. Once the requirements are clear, come up with a detailed level plan which consists of all integrations including system testing, regression testing, acceptance testing and project plan. Estimate the stories and try to retrofit it to determine the number of sprints required. Also clearly call out all the dependencies, assumptions, key decisions and riks. Come up with an implementation plan with sprints dedicated for requirements, coding, testing and soft and actual launch.

- tell me a time when you had to deal with difficult team member.

- tell me how you made improvement to company.

- tell me your worst mistake. how did you recover / learn?

- how do you make sure the deliverables are of the right quality? what metrics do you use? 

- how do you handle disagreement with your boss?
Stay calm, explain that you feel differently and clearly explain your reasoning. Make a case for it with sound business logic rather than emotion. Ultimately if after explaining your case, they manager is unswayed, then it's time to "disagree and commit". Since a manager's role is to be strategic and understand the big picture, it's quite possible that they have some exposure to other things going on in the company that you aren't aware of which forms the basis for their opinion. Ultimately they are your manager, but with that said, I've never had a manager that didn't want to hear all sides and make the best decision based on information from his/her team members.

- give me a time when you had to proceed on a project with little information.

- give me a time when you had to work with multiple teams within organization.

- why Amazon?

Technical Questions
==============================================
- what is SSL/TLS?
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), both frequently referred to as "SSL", are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network.[1] Several versions of the protocols find widespread use in applications such as web browsing, email, Internet faxing, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP (VoIP). Websites are able to use TLS to secure all communications between their servers and web browsers.

The Transport Layer Security protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two communicating computer applications.[1]:3 When secured by TLS, connections between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., wikipedia.org) have one or more of the following properties:

The connection is private (or secure) because symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt the data transmitted. The keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based on a shared secret negotiated at the start of the session (see TLS handshake protocol). The server and client negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data is transmitted (see Algorithm below). The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected).
The identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using public-key cryptography. This authentication can be made optional, but is generally required for at least one of the parties (typically the server).
The connection ensures integrity because each message transmitted includes a message integrity check using a message authentication code to prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during transmission.[1]:3

- TCP vs UDP?
TCP - Acronym for	Transmission Control Protocol	
UDP - User Datagram Protocol or Universal Datagram Protocol
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol.	
UDP is a connectionless protocol.
TCP - Function	As a message makes its way across the internet from one computer to another. This is connection based.	
UDP - also a protocol used in message transport or transfer. This is not connection based which means that one program can send a load of packets to another and that would be the end of the relationship.
TCP is suited for applications that require high reliability, and transmission time is relatively less critical.	
UDP is suitable for applications that need fast, efficient transmission, such as games. UDP's stateless nature is also useful for servers that answer small queries from huge numbers of clients.
TCP - HTTP, HTTPs, FTP, SMTP, Telnet	
UDP - DNS, DHCP, TFTP, SNMP, RIP, VOIP.
