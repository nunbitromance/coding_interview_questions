Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
- Example 1: Customers were reporting issues on Facebook that they were seeing wrong price charged on credit card for installment. I investigated and suggested that we add descriptors to payment transactions.
- Example 2:
- Example 3:

Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job." 
- Example 1: Site dev manager was let go. Site engineers were having difficulty with performance issues. I helped.
- Example 2: CS application team was struggling with issues. I helped them.
- Example 3: 

Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". Because we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
- Example 1: A/B Testing framework vs purchasing third party software which added complexity

Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgement and good instincts.  They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
- Example 1: 

Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
- Example 1: 

Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognise people with exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organisation. Leaders develop leaders and are serious about their role in coaching others.  We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
- Hire: 4 new engineers
- Fire: 1 existing engineer

Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
- SLA on P0: 100% response within 5 minutes
- Testing, Metrics, Alerts, and Monitoring on all new features

Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 
- Mongo upgrade. rollback plan. volatility but took risk and proceeded.

Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.  There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.
- Decommission of New Relic. Switch to Data Dog. Saved 90% of cost.

Earn Trust
 Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.  Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odour smells of perfume.  They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are sceptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never compromise.

- give me an example of most difficult/complex project: Groupon - Inventory Management Service -> drifting -> (Dive Deep) -> warehouse management. Shipment tracking service - a lot of maintenance.
- give me an example of most exciting project: Smart Pay - 20% revenue
- give me a time when you hired wrong person: Took someone in who was passionate about maintaining existing service that came with him. Not willing to learn new languages. Had long discussions on areas to improved. He did not show motivation to improve. Had to put him on performance improvement plan. Had to document his tasks actual vs expected every day. Eventually, had to let him go after discussion with HR.
- give me a time when you hired someone who was successful: Hired someone from another company who was struggling because he wanted to do something exciting and challenging and his manager would not let him. Joined my team and I gave him in charge of something interesting. He took himself to next level and completed project very successfully.

- how do you make sure the deliverables are of the right quality? what metrics do you use? 
- how do you handle disagreement with your boss?
Stay calm, explain that you feel differently and clearly explain your reasoning. Make a case for it with sound business logic rather than emotion. Ultimately if after explaining your case, they manager is unswayed, then it's time to "disagree and commit". Since a manager's role is to be strategic and understand the big picture, it's quite possible that they have some exposure to other things going on in the company that you aren't aware of which forms the basis for their opinion. Ultimately they are your manager, but with that said, I've never had a manager that didn't want to hear all sides and make the best decision based on information from his/her team members.
- give me a time when you had to proceed on a project with little information.
- give me a time when you had to work with multiple teams within organization.
