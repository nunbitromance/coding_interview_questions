/*
Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

For example,
words: ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
L: 16.

Return the formatted lines as:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
Note: Each word is guaranteed not to exceed L in length.

Corner Cases:
A line other than the last line might contain only one word. What should you do in this case?
In this case, that line should be left-justified.

 * Given a sequence of words, and a limit on the number of characters that can be put 
 * in one line (line width). Put line breaks in the given sequence such that the 
 * lines are printed neatly
 * 
 * Solution:
 * Badness - We define badness has square of empty spaces in every line. So 2 empty space
 * on one line gets penalized as 4 (2^2) while 1 each empty space on 2 lines gets
 * penalized as 2(1 + 1). So we prefer 1 empty space on different lines over 2 empty space on
 * one line.
 * 
 * For every range i,j(words from i to j) find the cost of putting them on one line. If words 
 * from i to j cannot fit in one line cost will be infinite. Cost is calculated as square of
 * empty space left in line after fitting words from i to j.
 * 
 * Then apply this formula to get places where words need to be going on new line.
 * minCost[i] = minCost[j] + cost[i][j-1]
 * Above formula will try every value of j from i to len and see which one gives minimum 
 * cost to split words from i to len.
 * 
 * Space complexity is O(n^2)
 * Time complexity is O(n^2)
